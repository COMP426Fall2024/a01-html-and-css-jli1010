        <p>The play begins by introducing Electra, who has been married off by Clytemnestra and Aegisthus to a peasant, in order to prevent her from having high-status children who could avenge Agamemnon's death. The peasant treats her well and has respected her virginity, and in return she helps him with the household chores. However, Electra is still resentful of her new social status, and has purposely not told Aegisthus of her virginity, as it means that she is still "fit" to marry another, hopefully powerful, man.</p>

        <p>Orestes returns from wherever he was in disguise, and uses his anonymity to question Electra and determine whether she is loyal to him and Agamemnon, and whether she wants revenge for their father's murder. He notes that Electra's hair is cropped, representing her status as both a working girl and a woman in mourning. An aged servant recognizes Orestes from a scar on his brow, and he drops the disguise. </p>

        <p>They begin to plot how to murder both Aegisthus and Clytemnestra. The servant tells them that Aegisthus is currently in the stables preparing to sacrifice a bull. Orestes goes to kill Aegisthus, and kills him while his back is turned by smashing his spine (a parallel to how Aegisthus killed Agamemnon - in the bath). Electra curses at Aegisthus' corpse for a while, then sends the servant to tell Clytemnestra that she gave birth to a son ten days ago, inviting her to her house. Orestes returns with Aegisthus' body, and almost chickens out of killing Clytemnestra, but Electra convinces him that he must fulfill his duty to avenge Agamemnon. Clytemnestra rolls up in fine clothes and a chariot, a parallel to how Agamemnon rolled up to his own death. Clytemnestra monologues for a bit about her reasoning for killing Agamemnon and taking Aegisthus as a lover (he'd taken a lover, so she should be allowed to have one too), then they lure her into the house and stab her.</p>

        <p>Afterwards, Clytemnestra's godly brothers, Castor and Pollux, appear. They tell Electra and Orestes that Clytemnestra deserved to die, but they still hadn't acted justly, and tell the two what they have to do to atone and purge their souls.</p>
