        <h1>Electra</h1>
        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <p>Electra is a character in Greek mythology who appears frequently in tragedies. She is the main character in two Greek tragedies (plays): <a href="sophocles.html"><i>Electra</i> by Sophocles</a> and <a href="euripides.html"><i>Electra</i> by Euripides</a>. Both plays were written partially to respond to Aeschylus' <i>Agamemnon</i>. </p>
        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img id="vase" src="img/electra_vase.jpg" alt="A vase depicting Electra, Orestes, and Hermes">
            <p class="img-description">A vase depicting Electra, Orestes, and Hermes at Agamemnon's tomb circa 380-370 BC. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electra_(Euripides_play)#/media/File:Orestes_Elektra_Hermes_Louvre_K544.jpg">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

        <p>In Greek mythology, Electra was the daughter of King Agamemnon and Queen Clytemnestra of Mycenae, and had two sisters and a brother: Iphigenia, Chrysothemis, and Orestes. The general story is that before the Trojan War, Agamemnon had sacrified Iphigenia to the gods in order to get a favorable wind to set sail to Troy. When he returned, Clytemnestra and her lover, Aegisthus, killed him in revenge in order to make Aegisthus king.</p>
        <p>Orestes, Clytemnestra and Agamemnon's son, was not in Mycenae at the time (the reason differs between versions) and was therefore spared from also being killed, as he was a legitimate challenger for the throne. He returned several years later to avenge his father's death.</p>
        <p>Both tragedies begin at this point. Electra's role differs between the two versions, but ultimately assists Orestes in killing Clytemnestra and Aegisthus.</p>
        <p>Fun (?) fact: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electra_complex">Electra complex</a> is named after her.</p>
