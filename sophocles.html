        <h1>Sophocles' <i>Electra</i></h1>
        <p>The play begins with Orestes and his old slave (Old Man) returning to Mycenae to avenge Agamemnon, as instructed by one of Apollo's oracles. The Old Man leads Orestes to leave an offering at Agamemnon's grave. Electra enters the scene, mourning and lamenting the suffering she's experienced since Agamemnon's death. Chrysothemis then enters the scene with an offering that their mother, Clytemnestra, had ordered her to leave on Agamemnon's grave, due to a dream she had that Agamemnon had returned. Electra convinces her to throw away Clytemnestra's offering and instead leave one of their own.</p>

        <p>Clytemnestra appears with a servant, carrying her own offering. She tells Electra to get over it, and they argue about Agamemnon's death. Clytemnestra says that it was justified because he sacrified Iphigenia, which she thinks was unjustified because he was going off to rescue Menelaus' wife (Helen of Troy); why couldn't <i>he</i> sacrifice one of his daughters. She also says that Electra should get over it, because he would have just as quickly sacrificed her as well. Electra's counterargument is that the sacrifice was necessary, and Clytemnestra only killed Agamemnon so she could be with her lover, Aegisthus. She also argues that if Agamemnon had been alive, she would have been married off by now and would have had a better life.</p>

        <p>Afterwards, Clytemnestra prays to Apollo for several things, including the death of Orestes. As soon as she's done, the Old Man enters in disguise and announces that Orestes is dead. Clytemnestra is overjoyed that her prayer was answered, while Electra is overcome with grief. Clytemnestra ushers the Old Man into the palace as a guest.</p>

        <p>Chrysothemis returns from Agamemnon's grave and tells Electra that she thinks Orestes has returned, because fresh offerings were placed at the grave. Electra tells her that Orestes is dead and they must get revenge for him. Chrysothemis rejects the idea, saying it's too risky, and leaves Electra to grieve alone. Orestes then enters in disguise and gives Electra an urn that he says contains his (Orestes') ashes. Electra mourns loudly over it for some time until Orestes reveals himself, and then she is overcome with joy. The Old Man reappears and hurries Orestes inside the palace to kill Clytemnestra.</p>

        <p>Electra remains outside the palace to watch for Aegisthus' return, and listens to the sounds of Orestes killing Clytemnestra. When Aegisthus returns, he asks Electra where the person who told them Orestes was dead had gone, and she directs him into the palace. He demands to see Orestes' corpse, and Orestes brings him Clytemnestra's corpse instead. Once Aegisthus sees the corpse, he knows he's been trapped and it's over for him. Orestes escorts him inside to the location where Aegisthus had killed Agamemnon. The play ends before his death is announced.</p>
